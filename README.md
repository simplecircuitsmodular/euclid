# Euclid

Note that this is a prototype module. Documentation is spotty at best and the implementation of both hardware and software are no better. However, it does function.

## Features

This module is a 6 channel, 16 step Euclid sequencer based on an Arduino mega offering the ability to rotate patterns, change thier length, and store patterns to the built in eeprom.


## Files
### euclid_xx.ino
This is the Arduino code. It is incredibly rough and in major need of a refactor. I cobbled it together over several months, testing and modifying functions as I went. It does work but is far from clean.

### euclid_xx.sch
This is the hardware documentation. Feel free to use this as a starting point to design a PCB, but I built mine straight on perfboard. At some point I will likely have a board made.

### euclidParts_xx.md [Not Yet Complete]
This is the parts list. I haven't completed it yet since I'm still working on the hardware documentation.

### euclid.ai
This is the panel in Adobe Illustrator format. This can be used to manufacture a panel, which I do with 1/8" acrylic and a laser cutter.

## Updates

### 01 22AUG18
First push to GitHub. It works but needs a lot of clean up.
